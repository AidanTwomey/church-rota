# .devcontainer â€” .NET 9

This workspace includes a devcontainer configuration that uses the .NET 9 SDK image.

How to use
- In VS Code, open the Command Palette and choose "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container..."
- The repository will be mounted into /workspace inside the container.
- The C# extension (ms-dotnettools.csharp) is preinstalled.

Notes
- The devcontainer uses the image `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0`.
- After the container is created the `postCreateCommand` runs `dotnet --info` to verify the SDK.
